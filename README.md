# What this script can be used for

American Gut Project ERS phenotype files are composed of .xml files, that can be a bit hard to work with. This script converts them into a single .csv file for better data visualization.

# How to use

Download the ERS files and place them into a directory.
Run the script and input the path (or the name, if it's located inside the directory of this script) of the directory when asked.
Wait some minutes until the conversion is done. The output file will be named "phenotypes.csv".
